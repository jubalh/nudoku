Contained in official stable repositories since Debian Stretch.

```
emerge nudoku -a

### openSUSE ###

Since openSUSE Leap 42.1 (and Tumbleweed) you can find nudoku in the official repository.
For others you need to add the `games` repo.

```

zypper in nudoku
```

### From Source ###

#### Dependency ####
- ncurses

#### Compilation ####

Get the latest .tar.xz [release](https://github.com/jubalh/nudoku/releases) and extract it.
Then run:

```
./configure
make
./src/nudoku
```

For the git version you will have to do:

```
git clone https://github.com/jubalh/nudoku
cd nudoku
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
./src/nudoku
```

Add `-DDEBUG` to `make` to have some debug output.

##### I18n #####

For i18n support use `make` like this:

```
make install
LANGUAGE=es
./src/nudoku
```

You can replace `es` with any other language suported (suported languages are listed in `po/LINGUAS` file).
