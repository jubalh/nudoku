# nidoku #

nudoku is a ncurses based sudoku game.

## Install ##

### Using Package Manager ###

#### Arch Linux ####
I heard rumors of nudoku being in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nudoku-git/).

#### Debian and derivates ####
Contained in official stable repositories since Debian Stretch.

```
apt-get install nudoku
```

#### EL 7 (CentOS/Oracle Linux/Scientific Linux/RedHat ####
You need to enable the EPEL repository and run:

```
yum install nudoku
```
  
#### Fedora ####
nudoku is in the official Fedora repository since June 2016:

```
dnf install nudoku
```

#### Funtoo/Gentoo ####
Contained in official repo since 2018-02-16. Before that you had to use [strangeland-overlay](https://github.com/jubalh/strangeland-overlay).

```
emerge nudoku -a
```

### openSUSE ###

Since openSUSE Leap 42.1 (and Tumbleweed) you can find nudoku in the official repository.
For others you need to add the `games` repo.

```
zypper ar obs://games games
zypper in nudoku
```

### macOS ###

There is a [formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nudoku) for [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install nudoku
```

### From Source ###

#### Dependency ####
- ncurses
- cairo (optional: for PDF/PNG output)

#### Compilation ####

Get the latest .tar.xz [release](https://github.com/jubalh/nudoku/releases) and extract it.
Then run:

```
./configure
make
./src/nudoku
```

For the git version you will have to do:

```
git clone https://github.com/jubalh/nudoku
cd nudoku
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
./src/nudoku
```

Add `-DDEBUG` to `make` to have some debug output.

nudoku can also output sudokus in PDF and PNG format (see `man nudoku` -p/-i/-n).
You need to have cairo installed and configure with:

```
./configure --enable-cairo
```

##### Usage #####

For normal interactive GUI run `nudoku`.
To print two PDF pages with 8 hard sudokus run `nudoku -p riddle.pdf -n 8 -d hard`.
To get a PNG with an easy sudoku run `nudoku -i sudoku.png -d easy`.
See `man nudoku` to learn more.

##### I18n #####

For i18n support use `make` like this:

```
make install
LANGUAGE=es
./src/nudoku
```

You can replace `es` with any other language suported (suported languages are listed in `po/LINGUAS` file).
